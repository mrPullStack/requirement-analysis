# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository contains the deliverables for the **Requirement Analysis Project** focusing on the development of a **Booking Management System**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the process of gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements to create a solid foundation for software development.

The project emphasizes real-world application of requirement analysis principles, including identifying functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual representations using diagrams, and defining clear acceptance criteria. By following this structured approach, the project aims to ensure clarity, precision, and alignment with business and user goals in the early stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation for designing, developing, and deploying software that aligns with business goals and user needs.

During this phase, business analysts, project managers, and development teams collaborate with stakeholders to understand what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The process may include interviews, surveys, workshops, brainstorming sessions, and the use of modeling tools to capture and visualize requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- **Defines Project Scope:** Clearly outlines what is in and out of scope to prevent scope creep.
- **Aligns Stakeholder Expectations:** Ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the project goals and deliverables.
- **Guides Design and Development:** Provides the technical team with precise guidelines to build the right solution.
- **Reduces Risks:** Early identification of potential issues and requirements gaps minimizes costly changes later in development.
- **Supports Quality Assurance:** Helps in defining acceptance criteria for testing and validation.
- **Optimizes Resources:** Ensures that time, budget, and effort are directed toward features that deliver the most value.

A thorough Requirement Analysis is essential for the success of any software project, as it lays the groundwork for all subsequent phases, including design, development, testing, and deployment.
