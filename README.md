# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository contains the deliverables for the **Requirement Analysis Project** focusing on the development of a **Booking Management System**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the process of gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements to create a solid foundation for software development.

The project emphasizes real-world application of requirement analysis principles, including identifying functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual representations using diagrams, and defining clear acceptance criteria. By following this structured approach, the project aims to ensure clarity, precision, and alignment with business and user goals in the early stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
